-- | Map an array conditionally, only return the array when all elements were mapped.
-- | Note that this function is an alias for `traverse`. This is specific behavior for the implementation of `<*>` for `Applicative Maybe`.

-- | Hint: mapAny can be found in Data.Foldable.Extra

-- | ```purescript
-- | mapAll (\x -> if x == 2 then Just 99 else Nothing) [1,2,3] == Nothing
-- | mapAll (\x -> Just (x * 2)) [1,2,3] == Just [2,4,6]
-- | ```
mapAll :: forall a b f. Traversable f => (a -> Maybe b) -> f a -> Maybe (f b)
mapAll = traverse

-- | Like map but extracts the replaced values into an array. Allows modification of the replaced values as well.
mapModify :: forall a f. Traversable f => (a -> { old :: a, new :: a }) -> f a -> Tuple (Array a) (f a)
mapModify f l = traverse (\a -> (\{ old, new } -> Tuple [ old ] new) (f a)) l

-- | Conditionally map the function over the the functor. Returns a Tuple with the new functor and the replaced values.
mapMaybeWrite :: forall a f. Traversable f => (a -> Maybe a) -> f a -> Tuple (Array a) (f a)
mapMaybeWrite f l = traverse (\a -> maybe (Tuple [] a) (\a' -> Tuple [ a ] a') (f a)) l

-- | Same as mapMaybeWrite but allows modification of replaced values before returning them.
-- | Useful when the old and new values need to be linked to each other.
